1) Download the Raspbian Stretch Lite image (1.9Gb) from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
2) If not already installed, install Etcher, cf https://www.balena.io/etcher/
3) Launch Etcher
4) Plug the 8Gb microSD card
5) Select the downloaded image
6) Select the microSD card
7) Flash!
8) Create an empy file named "ssh" on the boot drive of the miccroSD card
9) Insert the microSD into the Raspberry Pi
10) Connect the Raspberry Pi to the network
11) Turn on the Raspberry Pi
12) Get the IP adress of the local computer with ifconfig, lets say its a.b.c.d
13) Scan the devices on the local network with the command `nmap -sP a.b.c.0/24`
14) Connect to the Raspberry Pi through ssh with the command `ssh pi@ip.addr.goes.here`, defulat password is raspberry
15) Setup the Raspberry Pi with `sudo raspi-config`
16) Change the password, locale and timezone, expand the file system, and exit
17) Set the hostname with the following commands
sudo hostname Squidlet001  # whatever name you chose
sudo nano /etc/hostname    # change the hostname here too
sudo nano /etc/hosts       # change "raspberrypi" to "Squidlet001"
18) Ensure the system time is right with the command `sudo apt install ntpdate -y`
19) Reboot with the command `sudo reboot`
20) Check the info about the CPUs and memory Raspberry Pi with the commands `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, `cat /proc/meminfo` and `vcgencmd measure_clock arm`. More usefull commands: `watch -n 1 cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`, `while true; do /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp && sleep 1; done`, `lscpu`
21) Check the temperature of the Raspberry Pi with the command `vcgencmd measure_temp`, should be kept under around 70 degrees celsius
22) Cf https://www.maketecheasier.com/finding-raspberry-pi-system-information/ for more information
23) Make a directory to clone the git repositories with the command `mkdir ~/GitHub`
24) Move to the ~/GitHub directory
25) Clone the repository PBMake with the command `git clone https://github.com/BayashiPascal/PBMake.git`
26) Edit the root Makefile with the command `nano ~/GitHub/PBMake/Makefile.inc` and change the value of ROOT_DIR with /home/pi/GitHub/
27) Clone the repository TheSquid with the command `git clone https://github.com/BayashiPascal/TheSquid.git`
28) Move to the ~/GitHub/TheSquid directory
29) Open the Makefile with the command `nano Makefile` and make sure the BUILD_MODE is set to '1'
30) Compile the repository with the command `make`, others repository are automatically installed
